                        Here's the deal bro:
                        Alright alright, so scenario right? You're watching the superbowl with your dad. He's a die-hard Brady fan,
                        prospectful of yet another ring. Fourth quarter, fourth down, patriots down by three. The Pats line up to attempt 
                        at the field goal. Nothing can go wrong, we got that trophy already. As the ball leaves the kicker's foot's touch,
                        the referee jumps into the air and blocks the ball with his giant forehead, deflecting the ball. The ball is caught
                        by Nick Foles, and Foles goes for the winning TD. You, who probably care nothing about football, watches in 
                        shock as your football father falls to his knees and groans in agony.

                        Refs ruin lives, it's a known fact bro.
